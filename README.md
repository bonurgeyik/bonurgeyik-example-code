# Project Title

Example Code for interview

### Getting started
There is one rdf file under the assets folder to ease the testing. You can unzip entire ~60k rdf files (http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/feeds/rdf-files.tar.zip) under the assets folder.

### Prerequisites

- Install Postgresql locally and create default database
- Install Node 10.x or higher
- Set src/config/config.js database parameters

### Installing

```
npm install
```
## Running the tests

```
npm run test
```

## Running the tests with coverage

```
npm run test:coverage
```

## Running the app

```
npm start
```

## Other Notes

* Test coverage files deliberately excluded from ignore file 
* Many improvements can be made with the code, and the project in general. Would love to discuss more on the call.
